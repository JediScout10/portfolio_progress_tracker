      <h1>Personal Progress Tracker</h1>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Existing productivity tools optimized for analytics, not consistency.
        This caused burnout and loss of focus during job preparation.
      </p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        I built a private discipline system centered on a single goal, daily
        focus, reflection, and streak-based consistency.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Calm UI</li>
        <li>Minimal cognitive load</li>
        <li>No analytics dashboards</li>
        <li>Emotion-aware UX</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Next.js App Router frontend with Supabase for authentication and data
        integrity. Public portfolio and private dashboard share one codebase.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>
        Designing for long-term behavior change requires restraint, not feature
        density.
